## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

### Try Different Regions:
```python
# In the notebook, change:
region = 'Fairbanks'  # Gold mining
region = 'Juneau'     # Gold belt
region = 'Iliamna'    # Pebble Cu-Mo-Au
```

### Try Different Elements:
```python
element = 'Au'  # Gold
element = 'Ag'  # Silver
element = 'Cu'  # Copper
element = 'REE' # Rare earths
```

### Adjust Parameters:
```python
threshold = 0.1      # Change economic cutoff
n_new_samples = 20   # More/fewer infill samples
grid_resolution = 150  # Higher resolution maps
```

### Add Your Own Analysis:
```python
# Add cells with custom insights:
# - Different kriging methods
# - Time-series analysis
# - Economic modeling
# - Machine learning integration
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AGDB4 not found"
```python
# Check path in notebook:
AGDB_PATH = Path('/Users/k.jones/Downloads/AGDB4_text')

# Make sure this directory exists and contains:
# - Geol_DeDuped.txt
# - Chem_A_Br.txt
# - etc.
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Install GeoStats with all dependencies:
cd /Users/k.jones/Desktop/geostats
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### "Out of memory"
```python
# Reduce grid resolution:
x_grid = np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), 50)  # Instead of 100

# Or reduce sample size:
data = data.sample(n=5000)  # Use subset
```

### "Notebook won't convert"
```bash
# Make sure jupytext is installed:
pip install jupytext

# Or manually copy-paste into Jupyter
```
